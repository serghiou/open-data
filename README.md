# Open Data in Healthcare

<div align="justify">
  
A collection of all databases of readily available healthcare-related data I know of.



## Single datasets

* **[MIMIC](https://mimic.physionet.org/)** "MIMIC is an openly available dataset developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, comprising deidentified health data associated with ~40,000 critical care patients. It includes demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, and more."

* **[Korean National Health Insurance Database.](https://nhiss.nhis.or.kr/bd/ab/bdaba000eng.do)** This database from South Korea provides deidentified claims, health screening data, and mortality data to researchers at minimal cost. A 2% sample (> 1 million individuals) can be downloaded from [here](https://nhiss.nhis.or.kr/bd/ab/bdaba022eng.do) and for full data access follow the guidelines at the end of page [here](https://nhiss.nhis.or.kr/bd/ab/bdaba032eng.do#). For a description of this database in the JAMA Internal Medicine click [here](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2479075).



## Collections of multiple datasets

* **[Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)** A collection of multiple highly valualbe healthcare-related datasets and competitions.

* **[National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/ftp_data.htm)** A collection of popular and high quality datasets, the most popular of which is National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

* **[IPUMS](https://www.ipums.org/)** "IPUMS provides census and survey data from around the world integrated across time and space. IPUMS integration and documentation makes it easy to study change, conduct comparative research, merge information across data types, and analyze individuals within family and community context. Data and services available free of charge." Some examples include IPUMS Global Health, which includes health survey data for Africa and Asia, and IPUMS Health Surveys, which contains historical and contemporary U.S. health survey data from NHIS (1963-present) and MEPS (1996-present).

* **[lodown.](http://asdfree.com/)** A fantastic package for R by Anthony Joseph Damico, which easily imports all sorts of freely available survey data, such as those from NHANES. The linked website also illustrates how to run basic descriptive queries on the data. The GitHub repository of the website can be found [here](https://github.com/ajdamico/asdfree).

* **[Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx).](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/)** A website that aims to maintain a comprehensive catalog of surveys, censuses, vital statistics, and other health-related data from around the world. You can search the website and download data directly from it. Such data includes those of NHANES.

* **[Global Health Observatory (GHO) data.](http://www.who.int/gho/database/en/)** "The GHO data repository contains an extensive list of indicators, which can be selected by theme or through a multi-dimension query functionality. It is the World Health Organization's main health statistics repository." Such data include adolescent birth rate data by country, suicide rate estimates and health workforce-related data. All data are ecological (i.e. across regions), not of individuals.

* **[Swedish National Data Service.](https://snd.gu.se/en/catalogue/search)** Use this website to search for studies of interest and then either directly download the data or, if not directly available, request the data for free from [here](https://snd.gu.se/en/catalogue/order-data). It is not currently clear whether access to raw data from multiple linked registries and not necessarily part of a study is readily available.



## Organizations managing access to multiple datasets (data request necessary)

* **[Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics.](https://www.ohdsi.org/)** A consortium attempting to bring many observational datasets from across the world together within a common data model. You can learn how to request data from OHDSI [here](https://www.ohdsi.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/NCI-OHDSI-instruction-manual2.pdf).

* **[Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC).](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/)** This provides researchers with online access to NHLBI biospecimen collections. Such data include data from the recent randomized-controlled trial SPRINT.
